# Introduction to Databases 


Databases are electronic storage systems for holding data, but their impact goes far beyond mere storage. They are essential for various real-world applications: banks use them for customer and transaction data, hospitals store patient and staff records, and online stores track profiles and purchase histories. These services collect vast amounts of diverse data, including user activity and IoT device data. This influx of data has driven advancements in database technology to manage the volume, variety, and complexity of big data. 

Whatever the source of the data a database will typically carry out the following actions, all of which developers such as yourself must be familiar with: 

  + Store the data
  + Form connections or relationships between segmented areas of the data,
  + Filter the data to show relevant records,
  + Search data to return matching records and
  + Have functions to lay the data to be updated, changed and deleted as required.

Don't worry if you don't fully understand all these terms for now, you're just receiving a brief introduction to databases and data. During the course you'll explore these concepts in more detail alongside the many other tasks that form the duties of a back-end developer. You will learn about:

  + The concepts of data and databases,
  + How data is related in the database,
  + The different database structures and their uses,
  + How to perform create, read, update and delete operations,
  + How to use SQL operators to sort and filter data, also  
  + What database normalization is and how to normalize a database.

You'll also get to build a fully operational database. 

In summary, this course provides you with a complete introduction to databases and as part of a program of courses that lead you towards a career and back end development.
