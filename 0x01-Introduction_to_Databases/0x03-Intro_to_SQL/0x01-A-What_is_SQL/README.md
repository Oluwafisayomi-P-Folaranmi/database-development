# What is SQL

At this stage in the course, you're probably familiar with the basics of **databases** and how they **store** and **manage data**. But it's also important that you know how to interact with databases in order to work with data. As a data engineer, you can interact with databases using the **Structured Query Language**.

What sort of interactions do database engineers need to establish with databases? Some of the operations you could carry on the data might require you to **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** data. These operations are also known as **CRUD** operations.

**SQL** is the standard language that can be used with all databases. It's particularly useful when working with relational databases, which require a language that can interact with structured data. Some examples of relational databases that **SQL** can interact with include: **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Oracle**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**. 

The next question this raises is how does a database interpret or read and execute instructions given by SQL? A database interprets and make sense of SQL instructions with the use of a **Database Management System (DBMS)**. As a web developer, you'll execute all SQL instructions on a database using a DBMS. The DBMS takes responsibility for transforming SQL instructions into a form that is understood by the underlying database.
