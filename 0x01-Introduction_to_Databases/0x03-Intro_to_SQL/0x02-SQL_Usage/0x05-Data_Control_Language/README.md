## **Data Control Language - DCL**

You can also use DCL or data control language *to control access to the database*. For example, using DCL commands, you control access to data stored in the database.

`GRANT` and `REVOKE` DDL commands are used to give users access privileges to data, and to revert access privileges already given to users. 

### **DCL**

You use DCL to deal with the rights and permissions of users of a database system.

You can execute SQL commands to perform different types of operations such as create and drop tables. To do this, **you need to have user rights set up**. This is called **user privileges**.

This category deals with advanced functions or operations in the database. Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. Use the following commands in this category:

#### **`GRANT`**

Command to provide the user of the database with the privileges required to allow users to access and manipulate the database. 

#### **`REVOKE`**

Command to remove permissions from any user.
