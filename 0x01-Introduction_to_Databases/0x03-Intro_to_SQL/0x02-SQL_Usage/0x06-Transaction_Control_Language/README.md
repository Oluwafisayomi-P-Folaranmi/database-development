## Transaction Control Language (TCL)

Finally, **the TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database. These are used to manage the changes made to the data in a table by utilizing the DML commands**. It also allows SQL statements to be grouped together into logical transactions.

This category deals with advanced functions or operations in a database. Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. Use the following commands in this category:

#### **`COMMIT`**

Command to save all the work you have already done in the database. 

#### **`ROLLBACK`**

Command to restore a database to the last committed state.

You should now be familiar with how SQL acts as the interface between the database and its users, and you should also be able to identify SQL operations and sub-languages. Great work!.
