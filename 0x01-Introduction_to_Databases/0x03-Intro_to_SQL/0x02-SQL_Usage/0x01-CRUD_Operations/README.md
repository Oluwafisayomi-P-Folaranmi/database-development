## **CRUD Operations**

So let's return to our **college database** scenario. **How can you possibly make all the changes in the database?** Well, with the help of what web developers called **CRUD operations**.

Performing CRUD operations is the most common task when working with the database. ***CRUD*** stands for **Create Read Update and Delete**. Or in operational terms: **create data**, **add/insert data**, **read data**, **update existing data** and **delete data**. 

Alongside these operations, **there are many other things that SQL can do**, depending on what SQL is used for. **It can be divided into many sub-sections or sub languages**. These include: 

  + **DDL** (Data Definition Language), 
  + **DML** (Data Manipulation Language), 
  + **DQL** (Data Query Language), and 
  + **DCL** (Data Control Language). 

We will take a closer look at these languages and their commands.

### **Common SQL Commands**

The objective of this reading is to teach you how to name and explain the main commands in SQL. Here you will learn about the main commands used in SQL. At a later stage you will explore relevant examples of how to use these commands with a detailed explanation of the SQL syntax for key operations such as to create, insert, update and delete data in the database.

As you already know, **you can interact with the database using SQL**. But just like with other coding languages, **you need experience with SQL syntax and it's subsets before we can make use of it**. In order to demonstrate SQL syntax and it subsets, **we will show the SQL commands that can be used to develop a database for a college**.

The SQL Commands are grouped into four categories: **DDL**, **DML**, **DCL** and **TCL** depending on their functionality, namely the type of operation they’re used to perform.  Let’s explore these commands in greater detail.
