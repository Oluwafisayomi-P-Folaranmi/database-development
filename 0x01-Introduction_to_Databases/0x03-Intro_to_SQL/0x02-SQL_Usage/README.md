Imagine that you've just been **hired to create a database for a college**. First, you need to create tables to hold data in all aspects of the college.

Then you need to **insert data into these tables and then modify this data whenever something changes**.

That's a lot of work. But it's all possible with the use of **SQL** and **CRUD** operations.
