## **Introduction**

As a data engineer, you can interact with databases using the **Structured Query Language**. What sort of interactions do database engineers need to establish with databases?

Some of the operations you could carry on the data might require you to **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** data. These operations are also known as **CRUD** operations.

**SQL** is the standard language that can be used with all databases. It's particularly useful when working with relational databases, which require a language that can interact with structured data. Some examples of relational databases that **SQL** can interact with include: **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Oracle**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**.
