# Database Engineer

This is a compilation of what some database engineers have to say.

> I really like this idea that in the end we're all solving human problems through technology. As a software engineer, my role is not to simply develop technological solutions, they need to have this human outcome. I'm Daniel Bloomfield Ramagem, I'm a software engineer for Meta. I joined the company in 2017 and I work out of our Washington DC office. My mother's recipe book, a spiral notebook with numbered pages and an index, serves as a personal database, demonstrating how structured data storage enables easy retrieval. While humorous, this example reflects the versatility of organized data systems, from personal recipes to global photo sharing on platforms like Facebook. This underscores the vital role of databases in supporting various functionalities across infrastructure. 


## Why do databases matter to software engineers?

> Data lies at the core of every application, shaping its effectiveness and influencing user experience. As a Database Engineer, you play a pivotal role in crafting a robust data layer that delivers swift and accurate responses, impacting various aspects of application development. Your work influences not just the user interface, but also clients, APIs, and the overall tech stack. Recognizing your significant influence, it's crucial to understand the importance of modeling, storing, and retrieving data effectively to facilitate seamless information consumption throughout the application. 


## What technical skills are important for a database engineer? 

> Technical skills I use on a daily basis. Certainly, I code. When I say code, I mean, normally I program using the standard programming languages for web. But I also work in the database space by creating the pipelines that produce, that extract, transform, and load a lot of the data that makes its way into the applications that we develop.


## What soft skills are important for a database engineer? 

> My daily work heavily relies on communication and organization, alongside technical skills acquired from school. While technical prowess is crucial, I've learned that effective communication is equally vital. Excelling in explaining technical concepts to both internal teams and end-users enhances the impact of our work. 


## What is most challenging about your role?

> In database development, the pursuit of perfection can hinder progress. It's tempting to over-complicate solutions, especially when considering various data scenarios and edge cases. However, this can result in complex and hard-to-maintain data schemas with performance issues. Instead, focus on current data needs and avoid prematurely addressing perceived scalability requirements. Start with small, iterative steps to better understand feature and data requirements. 


## What makes a successful database engineer?

> Engineers and database programmers typically focus on code and SQL queries as their primary output. However, this alone may not suffice. Supplement your work with writingâ€”whether it's documentation, code check-ins, updating wiki pages, or sharing insights in posts. Emphasize the importance of additional communication, which complements the code. Don't hesitate to write imperfectly; the key is to get into the habit of writing regularly. Connect your technical learning to practical applications, such as organizing recipes or tracking baseball cards, to better understand real-life problems and enhance digital communication skills.
