## Many-to-Many Relationship

If there are two tables, Table A and Table B, **a many-to-many (N:N) relationship means many records in Table A can relate to many records in Table B; and many records in Table B can relate to many records in Table A**.

This type of relationship associates one record of one table with multiple records of another table. The same relationship also works in the other direction. See a diagram below.

In this example, the student, Maurice Doyle, is undertaking two research projects and each project is supervised by different staff member.

Likewise, one staff member can supervise or collaborate with multiple students on their research projects.

These relationships can also be depicted in an ER diagram as many students are supervised by many staff.

You should now be able to outline the different relationships that exist between tables in a relational database model.
