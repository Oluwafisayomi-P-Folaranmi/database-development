# **Schema Definition**

**Schema Definition** or simply "Database Schema" is a suitable name that covers both table and database structures.

A **table structure** refers to the columns, data types, and constraints of a single table. A **database structure** refers to the overall organization of tables, relationships, keys, and constraints in the entire database.

The term **schema** represents the logical design of a database, including tables, columns, relationships, constraints, and indexes.

**The table is made up of rows and columns which hold data and a table is stored in a database that holds multiple tables**.
