# Tables in Databases 

At this stage of the course, you're probably familiar with the basics of how databases store and interact with data, but how do they store all this data and present it in a logical way? **In the form of tables**.

As you already know. **The table is made up of rows and columns which hold data and a table is stored in a database that holds multiple tables**. These tables are known as **relations** as they are all related to one another. 

In a more conceptual or logical sense, a table is also known as an **entity** in object oriented databases (ODB). An **entity** is an object that has attributes that are like columns or fields in a table. So in essence a **table**, **entity**, and **object** all refer to the same concept.
