## **Domains**

Another important concept related to tables is domains. A domain is the set of legal values that can be assigned to an attribute, basically this means making sure that the values of field can hold are well defined. For example, you can only place numbers in a numerical domain and you can only place characters or strings of characters in a string domain and each of these domains must include length values and other relevant rules that define its function.

Each row/record in a table is also uniquely identified by what's known as a primary key. A column in the table that has unique values will become the primary key of the table. In an employee table, for example, the id column is the primary key as each id is unique. This is because the other columns could contain repeating values. For example, two employees may share the same name or role. It's also possible for a primary key to be a combination of columns. If a single column alone doesn't possess unique values.
