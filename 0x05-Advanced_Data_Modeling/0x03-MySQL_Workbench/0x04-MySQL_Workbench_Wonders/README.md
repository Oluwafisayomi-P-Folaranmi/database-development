# **MySQL Workbench Wonders**

This reading outlines the role of MySQL Workbench in database modeling and data management. It provides an overview of the main database tasks that can be performed in MySQL Workbench.

## **Overview**

MySQL Workbench (WB) is a unified visual tool for database modeling and database management. The WB was developed by Oracle, the company that manage MySQL. MySQL Workbench is a free, open-source and cross-platform tool that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.

MySQL Workbench enables you to speed up the database design process by using the visual SQL editor. It also allows you to migrate data from different kinds of relational database systems.

## **Visual Database Design**

MySQL Workbench simplifies database design and maintenance. It enables database engineers to document the requirements in the form of visualized ER diagrams. This lets you communicate your design ideas with stakeholders in a professional way.

MySQL WB designer tool facilitates model-driven database development, which automates the development process without the need to code each part of the database system.

In addition, by using MySQL WB database engineers must design data models that meet the expected standards, otherwise they can’t implement these data models directly in MySQL.

In other words, MySQL WB allows you to develop a complete entity-relationship diagram with auto Layout and arrangement of data models.

## **Forward and Reverse Engineer Methods**

MySQL Workbench provides capabilities for creating data models in the visual designer. You can then use the Forward Engineer method to create a relevant data model in your MySQL server. The SQL schema is automatically generated for you. You can amend the code if required, or you can execute it with just a few mouse clicks.

MySQL Workbench also offers the Reverse Engineer method. You can use this method to create or import a MySQL database file and then generate a relevant data model from the SQL script. You can modify the model if needed, and then utilize the forward engineer method to create a new database system in MySQL.

## **Database Management**

Database management typically involves maintaining different versions of your database schemas. To help you with database management, MySQL WB can be used to perform Schema Synchronization and Comparison functionality. These features provide you with the ability to compare either two databases or a database and a data model, so you can visually detect the differences. MySQL WB also allows you to synchronize the data model with a live database and vice versa.

## **Database Documentation**

As a database engineer, you need to document the design of your database. This can be very time consuming. MySQL Workbench provides a documentation tool called DBDoc to document all details of your database design. You can use this tool to generate the documentation of your models in either HTML or plain text format.

## **The Visual SQL Editor**

MySQL WB visual SQL editor is used to write, run and debug SQL statements. It also facilitates SQL code completion and provides a context-sensitive list of SQL keywords and objects.

In addition, it includes a SQL code formatter that automatically formats SQL code to make it easier to read and edit. Other useful features include:

-   SQL syntax highlighting,
    
-   SQL code generation,
    
-   The ability to reuse  your favorite SQL snippets,
    
-   A running history of all executed SQL queries,
    
-   And the ability to quickly create tables, indexes, views, stored procedures, triggers and functions.
    

## **Visual Database Administration**

With MySQL WB you have complete administrative control over all aspects of your MySQL server, including:

-   User accounts,
    
-   Roles,
    
-   Privileges,
    
-   Server start/stop,
    
-   Logs,
    
-   And server configuration.
    

## **Data Management**

MySQL WB provides useful features for managing data in MySQL database including the ability import and export mysqldump files, and export query results sets as CSV, XML, HTML files.

The WB Visual Data Editor also allows you to view and edit result sets in a grid table.

You can also view multiple result sets in the same visual data window. And you can perform data search and pattern matching searches across all tables and schema.

## **Database Migration**

In MySQL WB, you can use the Database Migration Wizard to perform data migration between different versions of MySQL servers.

In addition, you can also perform data migration with different relational database management systems such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase ASE, Sybase SQL Anywhere, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

## **Conclusion**

MySQL Workbench has many useful tools that allow database developers to virtually create database models that can be easily transformed into physical MySQL databases.

Also, the WB allows MySQL administrators to configure and secure their database systems and assign users different types of roles and privileges.

In addition, it enables designers to use the visual editor to create database schemas, tables, views, stored procedures, functions and triggers.
