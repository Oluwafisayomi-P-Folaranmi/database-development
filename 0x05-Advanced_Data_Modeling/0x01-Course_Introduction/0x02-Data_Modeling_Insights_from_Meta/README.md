# **Data Modeling Insights from Meta**

The way the industry has developed **with the Internets, Web3, the Metaverse, you are going to be working on systems that connect to a database.** There are very few jobs that won't require this. So this is one of the most important fundamental skills that you can learn for a successful career.

**What Process Do you follow when Data Modeling?**

There's not a one size fits all process for data modeling. The process for developing a new data model for a new product is very different than retrofitting an old product to add a new feature or to comply with the new regulation. And so you will have to adjust your process accordingly to the needs that you're encountering and that's why these skills are so important to learn.

**Who conducts Data Modeling at Meta?**

Data modeling is conducted by different people **depending on the context we are *changing* or *creating* a data model for.** If we are building a new product and we already have the business case, this will be led by a lead engineer, generally discussing what **the high level needs of the product** are. If we are changing data model for user privacy or for a specific feature. The person leading that discussion, maybe the individual engineer or could be someone involved in the regulatory processes.

One thing that's very important about Meta is that every engineer is empowered to add to the discussion and change things. And so even though it may be a lead engineer that's designing the first data model and bringing it forward. Every engineer is expected to be able to talk about it and bring forward their ideas to improve our data models for our user needs and our products.

**What are Some of the Challenges a team may face when it comes to Data Modeling and how do you overcome them?**

One of the challenges at Meta around data modeling is making sure that we are using our user data properly and not when we are accessing new data that we are being responsible with that data. This is a big challenge because there's a lot of data that we have access to and we want to make sure we're only using the specific needs that we have and getting actually approvals for all these things.

And this can be a very arduous process because we do have to justify where we're getting our data from, how we're using it, how we're storing it, how long we're storing it for. There's a lot of details, and you have to be very prepared for those meetings and very prepared to justify why or why not you're including some data.

**How do you manage changes to the database?**

Managing changes to a database is a very complicated process and there's a lot of teams at Meta dedicated to ensuring that the data is stored securely, thatit is reliable, that there's fall backs. There's a lot of considerations you have to take into from an engineering perspective.

But from an overall infrastructure, there is a lot of teams managing and deploying the code and the database changes in order to make this work. So something like Meta or Facebook with its billions of users is not going to be maintained by a single individual. And so I think it's important to understand that because of database is a comment point for all the products that we have to take great care in making changes and we have to coordinate a lot of different other teams.

**What advice do you have for aspiring database engineers who are new to data modeling?**

If you really want to get good at data modeling, you have to really think about why are you getting your data, how you're storing it and how you're protecting it. So you really have to think about the trust that is being put into you when doing that, especially if you have your user information.

There are a lot of considerations that you're going to need to build a data model and the questions you need to ask are sometimes tough questions and you need to think about tradeoffs. I hope you walk away from this lesson learning that databases are **very complex systems** that require a lot of coordination. And even though one singular data model may be designed by one person, you're still going to need to be able to coordinate with lots of other technical and cross functional partners in order to build a successful database.
