# **Introduction to Advanced Data Modeling**

The focus of this course is on advanced data modeling. Let's take a few moments to review some of the new skills that you'll develop in these modules.

You'll begin the course with an introduction to the topic of advanced database modeling. You'll learn that a data model provides a visual representation of different data elements and shows how they relate to one another. You'll also discover how data modeling is used at Meta.

You will then explore database modeling in more detail by learning about different data models. You'll discover that there are three levels of database models: the conceptual data model, the logical data model, and the physical data model. You'll also review different models that you can use to design your database.

Next, you'll learn how to structure your tables to remove anomalies using database normalization. These include the insertion anomaly, the update anomaly, and the deletion anomaly. You'll also explore an example of a data model and design a database model in an exercise.

In the next lesson of this module, you'll receive an introduction to MySQL Workbench. You'll learn that MySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool for database modeling and management. It offers a range of useful features for creating, editing, and managing databases.

You'll then discover how MySQL Workbench is used to build a data model diagram. You'll then learn how **MySQL Workbench *forward engineer* feature** is used to turn this model into a database schema in MySQL. You'll also learn how you can use MySQL to ***reverse engineer*** a model. This means you can create a data model or ER diagram from an existing database. **This is essentially the opposite to the forward engineer feature.** You can print the model, share it, or apply changes and push it to the database using the forward engineering method.

You'll also complete this lesson with a quiz item and an exercise in which you'll design your own database model in MySQL Workbench.

In the next module, you'll explore the topic of data warehousing. In this module, you'll learn about the architecture of a data warehouse and build a dimensional data model.

You'll begin with an overview of the concept of data warehousing. You'll learn that a data warehouse is a centralized data repository that loads, integrates, stores, and processes large amounts of data from multiple sources. Users can then query this data to perform data analysis.

You'll then discover that a data warehouse is defined by four key characteristics: it's subject-oriented, it's integrated, it's non-volatile, and it's time-variant. You'll also review the different forms of data that a data warehouse handles, including structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data.

You will then explore the architecture of a data warehouse and learn that it includes the following components: data sources, the data staging area (which includes the ETL process), the data warehouse itself, and data marts. Once the data has been loaded from the data sources, it is then integrated and stored in the data warehouse. It's then organized in data marts, where users can perform data analysis and present their findings.

These components control the flow of data from different sources. They also process and integrate this data so that the user can perform data analysis. You will also explore a case study of a real-world data project.

In the second lesson of this module, you'll explore dimensional data modeling. The lesson begins with an overview of the fundamentals of dimensional data modeling. You'll learn that it's based on dimensions and facts and it's designed using star and snowflake schemas.

You will then explore some examples of dimensional data modeling in practice and learn that there are four key steps to follow when creating a model:
1. Choose the business process to explore.
2. Choose the grain or level of granularity.
3. Choose the dimensions.
4. Choose the facts.

Once you've made all these choices, you can then create the schema. Finally, you'll undertake an exercise in which you'll create your own dimensional model.

In the third module of this course, you'll explore data analytics in the context of dimensions and measures and you'll learn how to perform visualized data analysis using an advanced analytics tool.

You'll start with an overview of data analytics. You'll recap the basics of data analytics and the key types of data analytics that you've made use of at other points in your database engineering journey. You'll also learn that there are two generic types of data you'll deal with: quantitative data (numerical) and qualitative data (non-numerical).

When you've determined what data you need, you can process and analyze it using four measurements scales:
- The nominal scale
- The ordinal scale
- The interval scale
- The ratio scale

Next, you'll learn about the topics of data mining and machine learning. You'll learn that data mining is the process of detecting patterns in data while machine learning is the process of teaching a computer how to learn. Machine learning makes use of data mining models to process data like:
- Classification analysis
- The association rule
- Clustering analysis
- Regression analysis

You'll then learn about data visualization. You'll learn that when visualizing your data, you must consider your audience and the information they're looking for. You'll then need to choose an appropriate chart that best communicates this information. Finally, you'll conclude this lesson with a discussion around what data analytics reports you make use of.

In the final lesson of this module, you'll review the topic of data analytics and learn how to make use of data analytics tools like Tableau. As part of your introduction to Tableau, you'll learn what its key features are and how they help you perform data analytics.

You'll then learn how to use Tableau to analyze data. You'll learn how to download, launch, and navigate Tableau, load and prepare data for analysis, filter and visualize data, and create an interactive dashboard.

Finally, you'll complete an exercise in which you'll perform data analysis in Tableau.

Now that you've reached the end of this course introduction, it's time to get started on your advanced data modeling journey.

**Good luck.**
