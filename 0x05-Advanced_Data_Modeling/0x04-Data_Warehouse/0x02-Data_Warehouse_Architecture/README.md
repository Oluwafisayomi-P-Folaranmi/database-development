# **Data Warehouse Architecture**

At this stage of the course, you should be familiar with the concept of a data warehouse. But you might still have questions like: **What does a data warehouse look like, and how does it work?**

In this section, you'll explore the architecture of a data warehouse and understand how its components work together to facilitate data collection, integration, and analysis.

## **Real-World Context: Global Superstore**

Over at Global Superstore, they've begun building a data warehouse **to aggregate, integrate, and analyze data** to support their business decisions. As a database engineer, it's important that you understand the architecture of a data warehouse.

## **Overview of Data Warehouse Architecture**

The architecture of a data warehouse must control the flow of data from different sources. It needs to:

- Process incoming data
- Integrate it in a consistent format
- Allow users to perform data analysis and extract insights

To facilitate these operations, a data warehouse is composed of several components:

- ***Data Sources***  
- ***Data Staging Area*** 
- ***Data Storage*** (the Data Warehouse itself)  
- ***Data Marts***

## **Components of Data Warehouse Architecture**

### **1. Data Sources**

Data sources are the origin of insights in a data warehouse. These include:

- External sources: e.g., online surveys, social media data  
- Internal sources: company databases with customer and product info  
- Operational data: e.g., customer orders  
- Flat files: files without internal structure, like logs or customer browsing data  

Ensure that data sources are accurate to avoid irrelevant or misleading analytics.

### **2. Data Staging Area (ETL Pipeline)**

The data staging area includes the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. This involves:

- Extracting data from multiple sources  
- Transforming data into a uniform format  
- Loading it into the storage layer  

You’ll explore ETL in more detail later in the course.

### **3. Data Storage**

This central repository organizes data using relational databases. It includes:

- Structured tables for data storage  
- A metadata repository that contains information about:
  - Data sources
  - Data characteristics
  - Storage tables and their attributes  

#### **What is Metadata?**

Metadata acts like a table of contents for the data. It helps engineers:

- Track changes in source systems  
- Understand data attributes and lineage  
- Manage processes effectively  

For example, Global Superstore’s metadata may show where data came from, creation dates, authorship, and more.

### **4. Data Marts**

Data marts are subject-oriented databases tailored for specific user groups. Each mart contains a subset of data relevant to a particular function.

Example: Global Superstore might have separate data marts for:

- Sales  
- Inventory  
- Customer engagement  

These allow focused analysis on specific business domains.

## **Data Analytics and Presentation**

Once the data is ready, various analytics techniques (e.g., data mining) can be applied.

Data can then be presented in several formats:

- Interactive reports  
- Analytical dashboards  
- Static reports  

Global Superstore’s analysts use these outputs to uncover insights on sales, profits, and other key performance metrics.

## **Best Practices for Data Warehouse Architecture**

When working with data warehouse architecture, follow these best practices:

- Separate analytical and transactional operations  
- Use scalable solutions to handle growing data volumes  
- Build flexible architecture for future functionality  
- Ensure strong data security measures  
- Keep architecture simple and compatible with various data types  
- Make it easy to implement, use, and manage  
- Document the development process for future enhancements

## **Summary**

You should now be familiar with:

- The components of a data warehouse  
- How these components interact  
- Best practices for building a scalable and effective data warehouse architecture  

Great work!
