## **Types of Data Analysis**

There are different types of data analysis that can be performed within a database. Let's take a few moments to explore these types and learn how they inform data analytics.  

### **1. Descriptive Data Analysis**

**Descriptive data analysis** presents data in a descriptive format. In other words, it describes what happened.  

For example, Lucky Shrub can analyze their sales over a specific period. They can then describe the period using this data by referring to top-selling products and the profits they made.  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** attempts to establish a relationship between different variables in a database.  

- Is there a relationship between variables A and B?  
- Can you establish a link between variables X and Y?  

At Lucky Shrub, they use exploratory data analysis to determine if there's any correlation between an increase in sales for a specific product and the season in which it's sold—such as an increase in the sale of trees during the holiday season.  

### **3. Inferential Data Analysis**

**Inferential data analysis** focuses on a small sample of data to make inferences about a larger data population and draw general conclusions.  

Lucky Shrub often makes use of inferential data analysis. Their data shows an increase in the sale of barbecue products over the summer months. They can infer that this is the best period in which to sell these goods.  

### **4. Predictive Data Analysis**

**Predictive data analysis** uses existing or legacy data to identify paradigms and patterns. These patterns can then be used to make predictions about future performance.  

For example, Lucky Shrub’s data shows that the sale of gardening tools increases when these items are discounted. They can use this data to predict that further discounts will lead to more sales.  

### **5. Causal Data Analysis**

**Causal data analysis** explores the cause-and-effect relationships between different variables.  

- Did variable A cause B?  
- Did variable X have any effect on Y?  

Lucky Shrub's data shows that many customers who bought gardening tools also bought outdoor lighting products. **Causal data analysis** is a great way for Lucky Shrub to try and identify the relationship between these purchases.

**Data analysis** and **data analytics** interchangeably, although separate concepts, they are closely linked — you can't have **data analytics** without **data analysis**. Be aware of this fact when working with data analytics.  

You should now understand the concept of **data analytics** and be able to recognize different types of **data analysis**. **Well done!**
