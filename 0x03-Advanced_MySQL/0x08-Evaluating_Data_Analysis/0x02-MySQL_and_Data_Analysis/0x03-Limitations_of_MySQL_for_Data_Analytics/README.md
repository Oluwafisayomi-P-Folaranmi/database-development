## **Limitations of MySQL for Data Analytics**

### **1. Limited Data Analysis Capabilities**

While **MySQL** is effective for **basic** data analysis, its capabilities are **more limited** than those of advanced **data analytics tools**.  

Other tools provide **more powerful AI-backed** data analysis, allowing **database engineers** to:  

- Perform **complex** data analysis  
- Leverage **machine learning** for insights  
- Process **big data** more efficiently  

### **2. Lack of Data Visualization Features**

MySQL does **not** include built-in **data visualization** tools. Other **database analytics tools** offer visualization features such as:  

- **Bar charts**  
- **Graphs**  
- **Maps**  

These tools provide a much more effective way of **communicating insights** than just presenting data in tables.  

For example, with visualization tools, **Lucky Shrub could quickly**:  

- **Spot trends** in their sales data  
- **Identify major issues** in product performance

As you’ve just learned, **MySQL** offers many benefits as a **database management system**:  

✅ **Free and open-source**  
✅ **Relational model for structured data**  
✅ **Widely used across organizations**  

However, MySQL also has **limitations** when compared to more advanced **data analytics tools**:  

❌ **Limited advanced data analysis features**  
❌ **No built-in data visualization tools**  

Understanding these **strengths and weaknesses** will help you decide **when to use MySQL** for data analysis and when to integrate it with **other analytics tools**.
