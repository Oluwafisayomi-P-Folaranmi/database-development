## **Benefits of MySQL for Data Analysis**

As you progress through these courses, you've learned how powerful **MySQL** is. Another advantage of MySQL is that it offers **database engineers** the tools required to perform **data analysis** within their database.  

However, **MySQL also has limitations** when compared to more advanced data analytics tools. Let's take a few moments to explore these.

### **1. Relational Database Model**

MySQL databases are built using a **relational database model**. As you learned in a previous course, relational models structure data sets in related tables. These related tables make it easy to **access, retrieve, and analyze** related information.  

With **MySQL**, Lucky Shrub can connect their database tables using **foreign keys**. This means they can use one table to locate information in another.  

For example, the **orders** and **products** tables are connected through the **product ID** key. This relationship helps Lucky Shrub **identify the products that each client ordered**.  

### **2. Open-Source and Cost-Effective**

MySQL is a **free, open-source** database management system. This means there are:  

- **No licensing costs**  
- **No intellectual property concerns**  

For Lucky Shrub, this **reduces the cost of doing business** while maintaining a powerful and efficient database system.  

### **3. Widely Used and Highly Compatible**

Because of its **capacity and accessibility**, MySQL is one of the most widely used **database management systems**. Many **businesses, governments, and organizations** use MySQL to:  

- **Collect, store, and process data**  
- **Communicate data efficiently**  
- **Improve their data analytics**  

For example, **Lucky Shrub's suppliers also use MySQL** to manage their data. This allows Lucky Shrub to **share stock level updates** with their suppliers by sending them data from the **products table** in their database.
