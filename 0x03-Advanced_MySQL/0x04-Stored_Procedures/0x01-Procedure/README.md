# Procedure

Your company often perform the same queries on their database every day. Each time they perform these queries, they have to rewrite the same SQL code again. With MySQL, your company can use the stored procedure's method to save a specific query as a block of code that they can then recall whenever required.

A stored procedure is a block of code or pre-prepared query that can be stored in your database. You can then invoke or call the stored procedure using the call command. There are a lot of benefits to be gained from using stored procedures.
