# Data Analysis in SQL

The types of data analysis you may need to perform are very different. They include simple data extraction tasks using basic SQL queries; and also tasks that involve advanced subqueries, joining tables and creating virtual ones. Once these tasks are completed and the required data is extracted, they can analyze it and prepare it for data analytics.

Data can be collected from a database using a wide range of SQL queries which you are familiar with. For example:

  1. Joins: You can extract or collect data using joins to join two tables together.
  2. Subqueries: to create a query within a query.
  3. Views: to create virtual tables.
  4. Functions: You can also use functions to perform sophisticated operations, and
  5. Operators: return different results and filter required data using operators.

The basic process for performing data analysis in MySQL using SQL queries works as follows. You can extract the required data from your database using a wide range of one or more SQL queries. You can then use further SQL queries to present a description of the results of your data analysis. You can then gain further insight from these initial results using data analytics.
