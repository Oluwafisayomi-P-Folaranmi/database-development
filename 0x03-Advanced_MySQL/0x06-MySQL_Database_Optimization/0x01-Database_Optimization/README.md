## **Database Optimization?**

***Database optimization is improving the performance of a database system to reduce the time it takes to query, process, and transmit a user's query***. Basically, it's the process of maximizing the speed and efficiency of the database's performance. An optimized database can process a SQL query and return the required data fast. 

***It's also important to note that database performance depends on both hardware and software***. In this lesson, you'll focus on optimizing queries using MySQL software.
