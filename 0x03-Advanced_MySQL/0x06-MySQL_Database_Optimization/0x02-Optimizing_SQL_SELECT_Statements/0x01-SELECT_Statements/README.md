## **Understanding SELECT Statements**

As you might already know, **SELECT statements** belong to a category of SQL statements called **data retrieval statements**. These statements are designed to **return data from the database**.  

However, if they are **not optimized correctly**, they:
  
  ❌ Add **extra load** to the database  
  ❌ **Slow down performance**  
  ❌ Increase the **execution time** of queries  

To ensure efficient database performance, you should follow some **basic optimization guidelines**.
