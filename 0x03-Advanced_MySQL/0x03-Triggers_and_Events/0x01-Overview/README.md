# Overview

Triggers in SQL.

As an engineer working on the data access layer of your company's application, you'll often need certain actions to occur automatically when specific events take place in your database, like when data is inserted, updated or deleted from a table. But how can you make sure that these actions happen automatically and avoid the need to rewrite code each time they must be invoked, you can do this with the use of triggers.

SQL triggers are typically used to perform three types of actions except.

  + insert data into a table
  + update data in a table
  + create a table
  + delete data from a table
