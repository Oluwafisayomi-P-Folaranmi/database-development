## **Transactions in MySQL?**

A **transaction** in MySQL is one or more queries that can be committed permanently to the database. The database can also be rolled back to its original state if any of the queries fail to execute as required.  

MySQL provides the following statements for managing database transactions:

- `START TRANSACTION`
- `BEGIN` or `BEGIN WORK`
- `COMMIT`
- `ROLLBACK`
