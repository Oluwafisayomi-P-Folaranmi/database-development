## **✅ Little Lemon Restaurant**

**Practice working with the `REPLACE INTO` statement.**

Let’s apply what you have learned about the `REPLACE INTO` statement in different situations.

Let's begin by exploring the following `starters` table structure from the `little_lemon` database.

It consists of three columns/fields:

* `starter_name` — set as the **primary key**
* `cost`
* `starter_type` — with a **default** value of `"Mediterranean"`

### **Task 1:**

Use the `REPLACE` statement to insert a new data record with the following details.

+ The ‘StarterName’ = Cheese bread
+ The ‘Cost’ = 9.50 and 
+ The ‘StarterType’ = Indian 

### **Task 2:**

Use the `REPLACE` statement to change the cost of the Cheese bread from $9.50 to $9.75.
