## **Functions**

Here's a quick reminder of what database engineers mean by the term ***functions in the context of MySQL***.

From earlier lessons, ***a function is a piece of code that performs an operation and returns a result***. Some functions accept parameters or arguments, while other functions do not. Functions are very useful for manipulating data in a database table. 

### **Functions in MySQL**

MySQL functions can be grouped into ***six*** different categories as follows:

  + ***String*** Functions
  + ***Numeric*** Functions
  + ***Aggregate*** Functions
  + ***Date*** and ***Time*** Functions
  + ***Comparison*** Functions
  + ***Control Flow*** Functions
  + ***JSON*** Functions
